I religiously practice SOLID and TDD where possible, so I rejected any solution that could not be easily unit tested and didn’t use DI.
This led me to split the major components of this project into their own subsystems.
-Input
-Number Parsing
(Here I made the decision to return an object that essentially represents a numbers metadata for ease of parsing and testing)
-English languauge number to word mapping
-Currency String generation

I unit tested all these subsystems thoroughly given the wide variety of inputs and expected outputs.
A full test plan seemed grossly unnecessary given that unit tests covered a huge varity of inputs.
Given that most of these were dependant on the mapping between numbers and words I incorporated the mapping tests within the test cases for the other unit tests using a varierty of test cases.
